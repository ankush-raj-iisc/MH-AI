Pursuant to a preliminary examination conducted in the Illiquid Stock  Options  matter,  Interim  order  was  passed  by  SEBI  on  August  20,  2015 which was confirmed vide Orders dated July 30, 2016 and August22, 2016. In this regard, SEBI conducted an investigation into the trading activity in the illiquid stock  options  Segment  at  BSE  for  the  period  April  01,  2014  to  September  30, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as “Investigation Period/IP”) and completed in the year  2018.  The  investigation  revealed  that  14,720  entities  were  involved  in  _____________________________________________________________________________________Adjudication Order against Late Ms. Gunmala Jain in the matter of Illiquid Stock Options at BSE Page 2of 5executing   non-genuine  trades  in  BSE’s  stock  option  segment  during  the investigation period.2.It was observed during the course of investigation that a total of 2,91,643 trades comprising  81.38%  of  all  the  trades  executed  in  the  stock  options  segment  at BSE during the investigation period were trades which involved reversal of buy and sell positions by the clients and counterparties in a contract on the same day. It was also observed that the aforesaid trades resulted into creation of artificial volume to the tune of 826.21 Crore units or 54.68% of the total market volume in stock options segment of BSE during the investigation period.3.In view of the large scale reversal of trades that were observed in the illiquid stock options  segment  at  BSE,  it  is  alleged  that  these  trades  were  non-genuine in nature. It was observed that Late Ms. Gunmala Jain(PAN No. ACUPJ2135P)(hereinafter  referred  to  as  “Noticee”)  was  one  of  the  various  entities  which indulged in execution of the non-genuine trades in the stock options segment at BSE during the above referred investigation period. It was observed that Noticee had entered into reversal trades with his counterparties which involved squaring off transactions  with  significant  difference  in  sell  value  and  buy  value  of  the transactions. 4.Therefore,  it  was  alleged  that  Noticee  had  executed  the  reversal  trades  which were non-genuine in nature and have created false or misleading appearance of trading in  terms  of  creation  of  artificial  volume  in  the  stock  options  segment  at  _____________________________________________________________________________________Adjudication Order against Late Ms. Gunmala Jain in the matter of Illiquid Stock Options at BSE Page 3of 5BSE  and  therefore,  it  is  alleged  that the  Noticee  has  violated  the provisions  of Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and Regulation 4(1), 4(2) (a) of the SEBI (Prohibition of   Fraudulent and   Unfair   Trade   Practices   relating   to   Securities   Markets) Regulations, 2003 (here in after referred to as “PFUTP Regulations”). In view of the  above,  adjudication  proceedings  have  been  initiated  against  the  Noticee under the provisions ofSection 15HA of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as ‘SEBI Act’).APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER5.In  this  regard,  SEBI,  after  being  satisfied  that  there  are  sufficient  grounds  to inquire into the affairs and adjudicate upon the alleged violations as mentioned above  inter-alia  in  respect  of  Noticee,  had  appointed  the  undersigned  as Adjudicating Officer (‘AO’) under section 19 read with section 15-I(1) of the SEBI Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as “SEBI Act”) and Rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties by Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter,  referred  to  as  “Adjudication  Rules,  1995”)  communicated  vide communique  dated July  27,  2021to  conduct  adjudication  proceedings  in  the manner specified under rule 4 of Adjudication Rules, 1995 read with section 15-I (1) and (2) of SEBI Act, and if satisfied that penalty is liable, impose such penalty as deemed fit in terms of rule 5 of Adjudication Rules, 1995 and section 15HA of SEBI Act.  _____________________________________________________________________________________Adjudication Order against Late Ms. Gunmala Jain in the matter of Illiquid Stock Options at BSE Page 4of 5SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND HEARING6.Subsequently, aShow Cause Notice dated August 04, 2022 (hereinafter referred to as, the SCN) was served upon the Noticee under rule 4(1) of the Adjudication Rules, 1995 to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be held and penalty benot imposed against him under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act for the alleged violation of the provisions of regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and 4(1), 4(2)(a) of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003.7.However,  vide letter  dated  March,  25,  2023, emailsdated May  29,  2023  and September 11,2023,Authorized Representative(AR)of the Noticee authorized by the legal heir and son of the Noticee, apprisedthis office about the demiseof the Noticeeon September 18, 2017. 8.The  Death  Certificate provided  by  the AR,was issued by  theIndoreMunicipal Corporationandshows  that  the  Noticee  had  passed  away  on September  18, 2017. The death certificate was verified from the website of aforesaid Municipal Corporation and the same is also on record. Thus, the proceedings are against the  acts  of  omission  and  commission  of  a  person  who  is  no  more  to  face  the charges. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that in Girijanandini Vs Bijendra Narain  (AIR  1967  SC  2110), the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that in case of personal  actions,  i.e.,  the  actions  where  the  relief  sought  is  personal  to  the deceased, the right to sue will not survive to or against the representatives and in such cases the maxim actio personalis moritur cum persona(personal action  _____________________________________________________________________________________Adjudication Order against Late Ms. Gunmala Jain in the matter of Illiquid Stock Options at BSE Page 5of 5dies with the death of the person) would apply. It is also relevant to refer to the decision of Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in Chandravadan J. Dalal vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 35/2004)decided on June 15, 2005) wherein it was held that: “The appeal abates since the appellant during the pendency of the appeal died on 29th November 2004. The appeal accordingly abates. The penalty imposed on the original appellant being personal in nature also abates.” 9.In  view  of  the  foregoing,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the adjudication  proceedings initiated  against  the  Noticee  will  not  survive  and  is  liable  to  be  abated  without going into the merits of the case qua herand the SCN dated August 04, 2022 issued against heris disposed of accordingly.10.In terms of Rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules, 1995, copy of this order is sent to the Noticee’s last known address and also to SEBI.Place: MumbaiG.

Such scheme can be a onetime scheme for this class of person. The terms of settlement should be attractive so that it could attract the noticees / entities to  come  forward  and  settle  the  matter  which  will ameliorate  the harassment  of  penalty  proceedings  to  the  noticees  and  at  the same  time  would  help  to  clear  the  backlog  of  these  pending matters before various AOs.”(Emphasis Supplied)7.2.In  compliance  with  the  above  directions  of  the  Hon’ble  Securities Appellate Tribunal, SEBI has introduced a one-time settlement scheme called the SEBI Settlement Scheme, 2022,in terms of Regulation 26 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Settlement Proceedings) Regulations,  2018  in  the  matter  of  Illiquid  Stock  Options.  The  said  Adjudication Order in respect of Jitendra Kumar Shahin the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options at BSEPage 5of 20scheme  proposes  payment  of  Settlement  Amount  as  per  the  details given below:S NoNumber of Contracts*Settlement Amount (Rs.)11-51,00,000/-26-502,00,000/-351 and above5,00,000/-base amount + 10,000 per contract* You may refer to the relevant Annexure/table of the SCN which contains a summary of the contracts you entered to determine the applicable slab for settlement.7.3.The  period  of  the  SEBI  Settlement  Scheme,  2022  will  commence  on August 22, 2022 and will close on November 21, 2022, so as to provide an opportunity for settlement to the entities who have executed reversal trades in the stock options segment of BSE during the period April 01, 2014 to September 30, 2015, against whom enforcement proceedings have  been  initiated  and  are  pending.  In  case  you  wish  to  avail  the benefit  of  the  said  Scheme,  you  may  access  the  details  of  the  said Scheme,  which  would  be  available  on  the  website  of  SEBI  i.e. www.sebi.gov.in,during the said period.7.4.Necessary  application  for  settlement  may  be  filed  within  the  validity period of the scheme and payment of the settlement amount shall be made  online.

Adjudication Order in respect of Jitendra Kumar Shahin the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options at BSEPage 6of 208.Pursuant  to  that,  vide  public  notice  dated  November  21,  2022,  it  was advertised/informed that “Considering the interest of entities in availing the Scheme, the competent authority  has extended  the  period  of  the Scheme  till January 21, 2023”9.However, it  was observed that Noticee did not avail the SEBI Settlement Scheme. In view of which, the adjudication proceeding against the Noticee was resumed.10.Since, it was observed that the Noticee did not submit itsreply to the SCN, in the interest of natural justice, itwas provided an opportunity of hearing vide hearing notice dated May 09, 2023 served to the Noticee vide email dated May 10, 2023. SPAD returned undelivered. However, the Noticee did not appear for the said personal hearing. Therefore, it is observed that, the Noticee neither appeared for the hearing norsubmitted reply to the SCN.11.I am of the view that the principles of natural justice have been adhered to, as  the  SCN  and  the  Hearing  Notice  were  duly  served  upon  the  Noticee, which is on recordand sufficient opportunity was granted to himto reply to the SCN and appear for the personal hearing. Considering the fact that the Noticee  has  neither  filed  any  reply nor  has  availed  the  opportunity  of personal hearing despite service of notices upon him, I am of the view that hehasnothing to submit in terms of Rule 4(7) of the Adjudication Rules and the matter is being proceeded ex-parte in itsregard on the basis ofmaterial available on record. As the Noticee did not file any reply to the SCN, it can be presumed that hehasadmitted the charges levelled against it.12.In this regard, it is pertinent to note that the Hon’ble SAT in the matter of Classic Credit Ltd. vs.SEBI(Appeal No. 68 of 2003 decided on December 08, 2006) has, inter alia, observed that, \"......the appellants did not file any  Adjudication Order in respect of Jitendra Kumar Shahin the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options at BSEPage 7of 20reply to the second show-cause notice. This being so, it has to be presumed that  the  charges  alleged  against  them  in  the  show cause  notice  were admitted by them”.13.Further, the Hon’ble SAT in the matter of Sanjay Kumar Tayal & Others vs SEBI(Appeal No. 68 of 2013 decided on February 11, 2014), has also, inter alia, observed that: “........... appellants have neither filed reply to show cause notices issued to them nor availed opportunity of personal hearing offered to them in the adjudication proceedings and, therefore, appellants are presumed to have admitted charges leveled against them in the show cause notices...”14.Additionally, the same position has been reiterated by the Hon’ble SAT in the matter of Dave Harihar Kirtibhai vs SEBI(Appeal No. 181 of 214 dated December  19,  2014),  wherein  the  Hon’ble  SAT  observed  as  under: “...further,  it  is  being  increasingly  observed  by  the  Tribunal  that  many persons/entities do not appear before SEBI (Respondent) to submit reply to  SCN  or,  even  worse,  do  not  accept  notices/letters  of  Respondent  and when orders are passed ex-parte by Respondent, appear before Tribunal in appeal and claim non-receipt of notice and do not appear and/or submit reply to SCN but claim violation of principles of natural justice due to not being  provided  opportunity  to  reply  to  SCN  or  not  provided  personal hearing.  This  leads  to  unnecessary  and  avoidable  loss  of  time  and resources  on  part  of  all  concerned  and  should  be  eschewed,  to  say  the least.  Hence,  this  case  is  being  decided  on  basis  of  material  before  this Tribunal...”15.In view of the observations made by the Hon’ble SAT, I find no reason to take  a  different  view  and  accordingly,  I  deem  it  appropriate  to  proceed against the Noticee ex-parte, based on the material available on record. Adjudication Order in respect of Jitendra Kumar Shahin the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options at BSEPage 8of 20CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS16.I have carefully perused the charges levelled against the Noticeeand the documents  / materialavailable  on  record.  The  issues  that  arise  for consideration in the present case are:(a)Whether the Noticee has violated provisions of Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1) and4(2)(a) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003? (b)Does  the  violation,  if  any, attract  monetary  penalty  under  section 15HAof the SEBI Act, 1992? (c)If  so,  what  would  be  the  quantum  of  monetary  penalty  that  can  be imposed  on  the  Noticee  after  taking  into  consideration  the  factors mentioned in section 15J of the SEBI Act, 1992? 17.Beforeproceeding further, I would like to refer to the relevant provisions of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003as below:PFUTP Regulations, 20033. Prohibition of certain dealings in securitiesNo person shall directly or indirectly—(a) buy, sell or otherwise deal in securities in a fraudulent manner;(b) use or employ, in connection with issue, purchase or sale of any security listed  or  proposed  to  be  listed  in  a  recognized  stock  exchange,  anymanipulative  or  deceptive  device  or  contrivance  in  contravention  of  the provisions of the Act or the rules or the regulations made there under;(c)  employ  any  device,  scheme  or  artifice  to  defraud  in  connection  with dealing in or issue of securities whichare listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange;(d) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with any dealing in  or  issue  of  securities  which  are  listed  or  proposed  to  be  listed  on  a  Adjudication Order in respect of Jitendra Kumar Shahin the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options at BSEPage 9of 20recognized stock exchange in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules and the regulations made there under.4.

Meanwhile,  SEBI initiated a detailed investigation relating to stock options segment of BSE which  was  completed  in  the  year  2018.  The  investigation  revealed  that 14,720  entities  were  involved  in  executing  non-genuine trades in BSE’s stock  option  segment  during  the  investigation  period. The  proceedings initiated vide the aforementioned Interim Order were disposed of vide Final Order  dated  April  05,  2018  also  considering  that  appropriate  action  was initiated against the said 14, 720 entities in a phased manner. During the course of hearing in the case of R. S. Ispat Ltd Vs SEBI, the Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), vide its Order dated October 14, 2019, inter alia observed that “SEBI may consider holding a Lok Adalat  Adjudication Order in respect of Jitendra Kumar Shahin the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options at BSEPage 10of 20or adopting any other alternative dispute resolution process with regard to the Illiquid Stock Options”.A   Settlement   Scheme   was   framed   under   the   SEBI   (Settlement Proceedings) Regulations, 2018, which provided one-time opportunity for settlement  of  proceedings  in  the  Illiquid  Stock  Options  matter.  The  said scheme  was  kept  open  from  August  01,  2020  till  December  31,  2020.  Adjudication proceedings were initiated against those entities who had not availed of the opportunity of settlement.Further, another settlement scheme was introduced pursuant to the order of Hon’ble SAT dated May 12, 2022. The details of SEBI settlement scheme is given at paragraph 8 above.19.I further note that there are no timelines prescribed in the SEBI Act, 1992 for the purpose of identifying trades as non-genuine. In this regard, I feel it is pertinent to note that, in the matter of SEBI Vs Bhavesh Pabari(2019) SCC Online SC 294, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India has, inter alia, held that:“There are judgments which hold that when the period of limitation is not prescribed, such power must be exercised within a reasonable time. What would be reasonable time, would depend upon the facts and circumstances of  the  case,  nature  of  the  default/statute,  prejudice  caused,  whether  the third-party rights had been created etc.”20.I shall now proceed to deal with the transactions executed by the Noticee in the alleged non-genuine trades.21.As  can  be  seen from  the  narration  of facts  in  the foregoing  paragraphs, I note that allegation against the Noticee is that, while dealing in the stock  Adjudication Order in respect of Jitendra Kumar Shahin the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options at BSEPage 11of 20option  contracts  at  BSE  during  the  IP,hehad  executed  reversal  trades which were allegedly non-genuine and the same had resulted in generation of  artificial  volume  in  stock  option  contracts  at  BSE.  Reversal  trades  are considered to  bethose  trades  in  which  an  entity  reverseshisbuy  or  sell positions in a contract with subsequent sell or buy positions with the same counterparty during the same day. The said reversal trades are alleged to be  non-genuine  trades  as  they  are  not  executed  in the normal  course  of trading, lack basic trading rationale, lead to false or misleading appearance of  trading  in  terms  of  generation  of  artificial  volumesandhence  are deceptive andmanipulative. 22.Inote from the trade log of the Noticee that hehad traded in 8contractsin the stock  options segment  of  BSE  during  the IP.  It  is  observed  that  the Noticee  had allegedly executed 39non-genuine  trades  in 8contracts.  I further note that the above mentioned trades of the Noticee had resulted inthecreation of  artificial  volume of41,63,000 units  in  the said contracts. Summary of non-genuine trades of the Noticee is as follows:S. No.Contract NameAvg. Buy Rate (Rs)Total Buy Volume (No. of units)Avg.

Further, alleged artificial volume generated by Noticee in the contract amounted to 100% of total volume generated by himin the contract. It is also noted that alleged artificial  volume  generatedby  the  Noticee  contributed in  the  range  of 11.28% to 100%of the total volume from the market in the said contract.24.The   details   of   squaring   up   doneby   the   Noticee   in   the   contract ‘SOIB15JUN28.00CEW1’ are as given below:Trade DateClient NameCP Client NameTrade TimeTrade Rate(Rs.)Traded QuantityBuy/Sellby the Noticee01/06/2015JITENDRA KUMAR SHAHPRAKASH MOHTA & CO  PRAKASH  KUMAR MOHTA13:40:310.9554000Buy01/06/2015PRAKASH MOHTA & CO  PRAKASH  KUMAR MOHTAJITENDRA KUMAR SHAH14:06:170.154000Selli.As can be seen from the table above, the trades executed by the Noticee in thecontract were squared up within a short span of time, with the same counterparty. The Noticee on June 01, 2015at 13:40:31 hrs entered into 1 buytrade with counterparty viz. Prakash Mohta & CO  Prakash  Kumar Mohtafor 54,000units  at  the  average  rate  of ₹0.95per  unit  in  the contract  ‘SOIB15JUN28.00CEW1’. Thereafter,   on   the   same   day,  Adjudication Order in respect of Jitendra Kumar Shahin the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options at BSEPage 13of 20Noticee entered into 1 selltrade at 14:06:17hrs for 54,000 unitsat the average rate of ₹0.1per unit.ii.These tradeswere entered into with the same counterpartyin the same contract. It is noted that while dealing in the said contract during the IP, theNoticee  executed  reversal  trades  with  same  counterpartyviz. Prakash  Mohta  &  CO   Prakash    Kumar  Mohta,on  the  same  day,  with significant price difference.Thus, the Noticee, through itsdealing in the contract  viz. ‘SOIB15JUN28.00CEW1’ during  the  I.P., executed  non genuine trades which was40% of the total trades from the market in the said  contract  during  the  I.P.,  and  thereby,  Noticee  generated  artificial volume of 1,08,000units which was 66.67% of the volume traded in the said contract from the market during the I.P.25.The  non-genuineness  of  these  transactions  executed  by  the  Noticee  is evident from the fact that there was no commercial basis as to why, within a   short   span   of   time,   the   Noticeereversed   the   position   withhiscounterparties  with  significant  price  differenceon  the  same  day.  The  fact that  the transactions  in  a  particular  contract  were  reversed  with  the  same counterparties indicates a prior meeting of minds with a view to execute the reversal trades at a pre-determined price. Since these trades were done in illiquid option contract, there was negligible trading in the said contract and hence, there was no price discovery in the strictest terms. The wide variation in prices of the said contract, within a short span of time, is a clear indication that there  was  pre-determination  in  the  prices  by  the  counterparties  while executing  the  trades.  Thus,  it  is  observed  that  Noticee  had  indulged  in reversal  trades  with  itscounterpartyin  the  stock  options  segment of  BSE and the same were non-genuine trades. Adjudication Order in respect of Jitendra Kumar Shahin the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options at BSEPage 14of 2026.I note that it is not mere coincidence that the Noticee could match histrades with  the  same  counterparty  with  whom hehad  undertaken  first  leg  of  the respective trades. The  fact  that  the  transactions  in  a  particular  contract were  reversed with  the  same  counterpartyfor the same quantity of units,indicates    a    prior    meeting    of minds  with  a  view  to  execute the  reversal trades at a pre-determined price. This is the outcome of meeting of minds elsewhere and it was a deliberate attempt to deal in such a manner. I note in matters dealing with violation of PFUTP Regulations, 2003, the reason as regardsexecution of   non-genuine   trades   might   notbe   immediately forthcoming.However, thecorrecttest instead, is one of preponderance of probabilities. Here I would like to rely on the judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court  in SEBI  v  Kishore  R  Ajmera(AIR2016SC1079) decidedonFebruary23,2016,whereinitwas held that-“...According to us, knowledge of who the 2ndparty / client or the broker is, is notrelevant at all. While the screen based trading system keeps the identity of the parties anonymous it will  be  too  naïve  to  rest  the  final  conclusions  on  the  said  basis  which overlooksameetingofmindselsewhere.Directproofofsuch  meetingofminds elsewhere wouldrarelybeforthcoming...in the absence of direct proof of meeting of minds elsewhere in synchronizedtransactions,thetestshouldbeoneofpreponderanceof probabilities as far as adjudication of civil liability arising  out  of  the  violation  of  the  Act  orprovisionoftheRegulationsisconcerned.Theconclusionhastobe gatheredfromvariouscircumstanceslikethatvolumeofthetradeeffected;the periodofpersistencein tradingin theparticular scrip;theparticularsof thebuy and sell orders, namely, the volume  thereof;  the  proximity  of  time  between  the  two  and  such  other relevant factors. The illustrations are not exhaustive...”27.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further held in the same matter that–“It is a fundamental principle of law that proof of an allegation levelled against a person  may  be  in  the form  of  direct  substantive  evidence  or,  as  in  many  Adjudication Order in respect of Jitendra Kumar Shahin the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options at BSEPage 15of 20cases, such proof may have to be inferred by a logical process of reasoning from the totality of the attending facts and circumstances surrounding the allegations/charges  made  and  levelled.  While  direct  evidence  is  a  more certain  basis  to come  to  a  conclusion,  yet,  in  the  absence  thereof,the Courts  cannot  be  helpless.  It  is  the  judicial  duty  to  take  note  of  the immediate and proximate facts and circumstances surrounding the events on  which  the  charges/allegations  are  founded  and  to  reach  what  would appear  to  the  Court  to  be  a  reasonable  conclusion  therefrom.  The  test would  always  be  that  what  inferential  process  that  a  reasonable/prudent man would adopt to arrive at a conclusion.” The observations made in the aforesaid judgments of Hon’ble Supreme Court  apply  with  full  force  to  the  factsand  circumstances  of  the  present case. Therefore, applying the ratio of the above judgments, I am convinced that the execution of trades by the Noticee in the illiquid options segment with such precision in terms of order placement, time, price, quantity etc. and  also  the  fact  that  the  transactions  were  reversed  with  the  same counterparty  clearly  indicates  a  prior  meeting  of  minds  with  a  view  to execute the reversal trades at a pre-determined price. The only reason for the wide variation in prices of the same contract, within short span of timewas  a  clear  indication  that  there  was  pre-determination  in  the prices  by  both  the counterparty  when  executing  the  trades.  Thus, the  nature  of trading,  as  brought out  above,  clearly  indicates  an  element  of  prior  meeting    of  minds  and  therefore,  a  collusion  of  the  Noticee  with hiscounterparty to carry out the trades at pre-determined prices28.I note the following fromthe judgement of the Hon’ble SAT in the matter of Ketan Parekh vs SEBI(supra):In other words, if the factum of manipulation is established it will necessarily follow that the investors in the market had been induced to buy or sell and  Adjudication Order in respect of Jitendra Kumar Shahin the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options at BSEPage 16of 20that  no  further  proof  in  this  regard  is  required.  The  market,  as  already observed,  is  so wide  spread  that  it  may  not  be  humanly  possible  for  the Board  to  track  the  persons  who  were  actually  induced  to  buy  or  sell securities  as  a  result  of  manipulation  and  law  can  never  impose  on  the Board  a  burden  which  is  impossible  to  be  discharged.  This,  inour  view, clearly flows from the plain language of Regulation 4 (a) of the Regulations.29.I also place my reliance on the judgment of Hon’ble SupremeCourt in the matter of SEBI v Rakhi Trading Private Limited(Civil Appeal Nos. 1969, 3174-3177 and 3180 of 2011 decided on February 8, 2018), in which the Hon’ble SC held that -“Considering  the  reversal  transactions,  quantity, price and time and sale, parties being persistent in number of such trade transactions with huge price variations, it will be too naive to hold that the transactions  are  through  screen-based  trading  and  hence  anonymous. Such conclusion would be over-looking the prior meeting of minds involving synchronization of buy and sell order and not negotiated deals as per the board\\'s  circular.  The  impugned  transactions  are  manipulative/deceptive device to create a desired loss and/or profit. Such synchronized trading is violative of transparent norms of trading in securities.....”30.Further, the Hon’ble SAT in its judgement dated September 14, 2020 in the matter of Global Earth Properties and Developers Pvt.Ltd.relied upon the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  judgement  in  the matter of SEBI  v  Rakhi Trading Private Limited(Civil Appeal Nos. 1969, 3174-3177 and 3180 of 2011  decided  on  February  8,  2018),  and  held  that, “It  is  not  a  mere coincidence  that  the  Appellants  could  match  the  trades  with  the  counter party with whom he had undertaken the first leg of respective trade. In our opinion,  the  trades  were  non-genuine  trades  and  even  though  direct evidence  is  not available  in  the  instant  case  but  in  the  peculiar  facts  and circumstances of the present case there is an irresistible inference that can  Adjudication Order in respect of Jitendra Kumar Shahin the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options at BSEPage 17of 20be drawn that there was meeting of minds between the Appellants and the counter parties, and collusion with a view to trade at a predetermined price.”31.Therefore,  the  trading  behaviour  of  the  Noticee  confirms  that  such trades were  not  normal indicatingthat  the  trades  executed  by  the  Noticee  were not  genuine  trades  and  being  non-genuine,  created  an  appearance  of artificial trading volumes in respective contracts. In view of the above, I find that  the  allegation  of  violation  of  regulations  3(a),  (b),  (c),  (d),  4(1)  and 4(2)(a) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003by the Noticee stands established. Issue  No  2:  Does  the  violation,  if  any,  attract monetary  penalty  under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act, 1992 ?33.Considering the findings that the Noticee as mentioned above has executed non-genuine  trades  resulting  in  the  creation  of  artificial  volume,  thereby violating the provisions of Regulation 3(a), (b), (c) & (d) & Regulation 4(1) and 4(2)(a) of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003 and in terms of the judgmentof Hon’ble Supreme Court of  India in the matter of SEBI  Vs.  Shri  RAM Mutual Fund[2006] 68 SCL 216(sc) decided on May 23, 2006 held that “In our considered opinion, penalty is attracted as soon as the contravention of the statutory obligation as contemplated by the Act and the Regulations is established and hence the intention of the parties committing such violation becomes wholly irrelevant...”I am convinced that it is a fit case for imposition of  monetary  penalty  under  the  provisions  of  Section  15  HA  of  SEBI  Act which reads as under:Penalty for fraudulent and unfair trade practices.15HA.If  any  person  indulges  in  fraudulent  and  unfair  trade  practices relating to securities, he shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than five lakh rupees but which may extend totwenty -fivecrorerupeesor Adjudication Order in respect of Jitendra Kumar Shahin the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options at BSEPage 18of 20threetimestheamountofprofitsmadeoutofsuchpractices, whichever is higher.Issue 3:If so, what would be the quantum of monetary penalty that can be imposed  on  the  Noticee  after  taking  into  consideration  the  factors mentioned in Section 15J of the SEBI Act, 1992?34.While determining the quantum of penalty under Section 15HA of SEBI Act, it is important to consider the factors as stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act which reads as under: 15J.While adjudging quantum of penalty under[15-I or section 11 or section 11B, the Board or the adjudicating officer] shall have due regard to the following factors, namely:—(a)  the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default; (b)  the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; (c)  the repetitive nature of the default.

EAD/EAD-4/GR/BM/35769/2022dated 04.08.2022was served on  the  Noticeevia digitally  signed email. The aforesaid  SCN indicatedthe  nature  of  offence  alleged  to  havebeen committed by the Noticee and also intimated to the Noticee regarding the SEBI  Settlement Scheme,  2022.  The  intimation  regarding  settlement scheme given to the Noticee is as follows:7.1.SEBI has framed the SEBI Settlement Scheme, 2022 pursuant to the Order dated May 13, 2022 passed by the Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal,wherein the following directions were issued to SEBI:“17.  We  are,  thus,  of  the  opinion  that  SEBI  should  reconsider  and seriously  give  a  thought  in  coming  out  with  a  fresh  scheme  under Clause 26 of the Settlement Regulations, 2018. Such scheme can be a onetime scheme for this class of person. The terms of settlement should be attractive so that it could attract the noticees / entities to  come  forward  and  settle  the  matter  which  will  ameliorate  the harassment  of  penalty  proceedings  to  the  noticees  and  at  the same  time  would  help  to  clear  the  backlog  of  these  pending matters before various AOs.”(Emphasis Supplied)7.2.In  compliance  with  the  above  directions  of  the  Hon’ble  Securities Appellate Tribunal, SEBI has introduced a one-time settlement scheme called the SEBI Settlement Scheme, 2022,in terms of Regulation 26of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Settlement Proceedings) Regulations,  2018  in  the  matter  of  Illiquid  Stock  Options.  The  said scheme  proposes  payment  of  Settlement  Amount  as  per  the  details given below:S NoNumber of Contracts*Settlement Amount (Rs.)11-51,00,000/-26-502,00,000/-351 and above5,00,000/-base amount + 10,000 per contract Adjudication Order in respect of Jitendra Kumar Somani in the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options at BSEPage 5of 19* You may refer to the relevant Annexure/table of the SCN which contains a summary of the contracts you entered to determine the applicable slab for settlement.7.3.The  period  of  the  SEBI  Settlement  Scheme,  2022  will  commence  on August 22, 2022 and will close on November 21, 2022, so as to provide an opportunity for settlement to the entities who have executed reversal trades in the stock options segment of BSE duringthe period April 01, 2014 to September 30, 2015, against whom enforcement proceedings have  been  initiated  and  are  pending.  In  case  you  wish  to  avail  the benefit  of  the  said  Scheme,  you  may  access  the  details  of  the  said Scheme,  which  would  be  available  onthe  website  of  SEBI  i.e. www.sebi.gov.in,during the said period.7.4.Necessary  application  for  settlement  may  be  filed  within  the  validity period of the scheme and payment of the settlement amount shall be made  online. Additionally,  for  any  clarification  in  regard  to  settlement scheme, you may refer to the FAQs at SEBI website or send email to scheme2022@sebi.gov.in7.5.In case you do not wish to avail of the facility under the SEBI Settlement Scheme,   2022,   the   adjudication   proceedings   in   respect   of   the allegations contained in Part A of the SCN shall resume. Accordingly, an inquiry shall be held against you in terms of Adjudication Rules read with section 15-I of the SEBI Act, and penalty, if any, shall be imposed under section 15HA of the SEBI Act. In such case, you are called upon to file your reply within 30 days of receipt of this Show Cause Notice.8.Pursuant  to  that,  vide  public  notice  dated  November  21,  2022,  it  was advertised/informed that “Considering the interest of entities in availing the Scheme, the competent authority  has extended  the  period  of  the Scheme  till January 21, 2023” Adjudication Order in respect of Jitendra Kumar Somani in the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options at BSEPage 6of 199.However, it  was observed that Noticee did not avail the SEBI Settlement Scheme. In view of which, the adjudication proceeding against the Noticee was resumed.10.Since, it was observed that the Noticee did not submit itsreply to the SCN, in the interest of natural justice, itwas provided an opportunity of hearing vide hearing notice dated May 09, 2023served to the Noticee vide SPAD as well as email dated May 10, 2023.However, the Noticee did not appear for  the said  personal hearing. Therefore,  it  is  observed  that,  the  Noticee neither appeared for the hearing norsubmitted reply to the SCN.11.I am of the view that the principles of natural justice have been adhered to, as  the  SCN  and  the  Hearing  Notice  were  duly  served  upon  the  Noticee, which is on recordand sufficient opportunity was granted to himto reply to the SCN and appear for the personal hearing. Considering the fact that the Noticee  has  neither  filed  any  reply  nor  has  availed  the  opportunity  of personal hearing despite service of notices upon him, I am of the view that hehasnothing to submit in terms of Rule 4(7) of the Adjudication Rules and the matter is being proceeded ex-parte in itsregard on the basis of material available on record. As the Noticee did not file any reply to the SCN, it can be presumed that hehasadmitted the charges levelled against it.12.In this regard, it is pertinent to note that the Hon’ble SAT in the matter of Classic Credit Ltd. vs. SEBI(Appeal No. 68 of 2003 decided on December 08, 2006) has, inter alia, observed that, \"......the appellants did not file any reply to the second show-cause notice. This being so, it has to be presumed that  the  charges  alleged  against  them  in  the  show  cause  notice  were admitted by them”. Adjudication Order in respect of Jitendra Kumar Somani in the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options at BSEPage 7of 1913.Further, the Hon’ble SAT in the matter of Sanjay Kumar Tayal & Others vs SEBI(Appeal No. 68 of 2013 decided on February 11, 2014), has also, inter alia, observed that: “........... appellants have neither filed reply to show cause notices issued to them nor availed opportunity of personal hearingoffered to them in the adjudication proceedings and, therefore, appellants are presumed to have admitted charges leveled against them in the show cause notices...”14.Additionally, the same position has been reiterated by the Hon’ble SAT in the matter of Dave Harihar Kirtibhai vs SEBI(Appeal No. 181 of 214 dated December  19,  2014),  wherein  the  Hon’ble  SAT  observed  as  under: “...further,  it  is  being  increasingly  observed  by  the  Tribunal  that  many persons/entities do not appear before SEBI (Respondent) to submit reply to  SCN  or,  even  worse,  do  not  accept  notices/letters  of  Respondent  and when orders are passed ex-parte by Respondent, appear before Tribunal in appeal and claim non-receipt of notice and do not appear and/or submit reply to SCN but claim violation of principles of natural justice due to not being  provided  opportunity  to  reply  to  SCN  or  not  provided  personal hearing.  This  leads  to  unnecessary  and  avoidable  loss  of  time  and resources  on  part  of  all  concerned  and  should  be  eschewed,  to  say  the least.  Hence,  this  case  is  being  decided  on  basis  of  material  before  this Tribunal...”15.In view of the observations made by the Hon’ble SAT, I find no reason to take  a  different  view  and  accordingly,  I  deem  it  appropriate  to  proceed against the Noticee ex-parte, based on the material available on record. Adjudication Order in respect of Jitendra Kumar Somani in the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options at BSEPage 8of 19CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS16.I have carefully perused the charges levelled against the Noticeeand the documents  / materialavailable  on  record.  The  issues  that  arise  for consideration in the presentcase are:(a)Whether the Noticee has violated provisions of Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d), 4(1) and4(2)(a) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003? (b)Does  the  violation,  if  any, attract  monetary  penalty  under  section 15HAof the SEBI Act, 1992? (c)If  so,  what  would  be the  quantum  of  monetary  penalty  that  can  be imposed  on  the  Noticee  after  taking  into  consideration  the  factors mentioned in section 15J of the SEBI Act, 1992? 17.Beforeproceeding further, I would like to refer to the relevant provisions of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003as below:PFUTP Regulations, 20033. Prohibition of certain dealings in securitiesNo person shall directly or indirectly—(a) buy, sell or otherwise deal in securities in a fraudulent manner;(b) use or employ, in connection with issue, purchase or sale of any security listed  or  proposed  to  be  listed  in  a  recognized  stock  exchange,  any manipulative  or  deceptive  device  or  contrivance  in  contravention  of  the provisions of the Act or the rules or the regulations made there under;(c)  employ any  device,  scheme  or  artifice  to  defraud  in  connection  with dealing in or issue of securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognized stock exchange;(d) engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with any dealing in  or  issue  of  securities  which  are  listed  or  proposed  to  be  listed  on  a recognized stock exchange in contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules and the regulations made there under.

Prohibition of manipulative, fraudulent and unfair trade practices(1)  Without  prejudice  to  the  provisions  of  regulation  3,  no  person  shall indulge in a fraudulent or an unfair trade practice in securities.(2)  Dealing  in  securities  shall  be  deemed to  be  a  fraudulent  or  an  unfair trade practice if it involves fraud and may include all or any of the following, namely:—(a)  indulging  in  an  act  which  creates  false  or  misleading  appearance  of trading in the securities market;Issue No 1 :Whether the Noticee has violated provisions of  Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and Regulation 4(1) & 4(2)(a) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003?18.Before  proceeding  to  the  merits  of  the  case,  I  note  that pursuant  to  a preliminary  examination  conducted  in  the  Illiquid  Stock  Options  matter, Interim order was passed by SEBI on August 20, 2015 which was confirmed vide  Orders  dated  July  30,  2016  and  August  22, 2016.  Meanwhile,  SEBI initiated a detailed investigation relating to stock options segment of BSE which  was  completed  in  the  year  2018.  The  investigation  revealed  that 14,720  entities  were  involved  in  executing  non-genuine trades in BSE’s stock  option  segment  during  the  investigation  period. The  proceedings initiated vide the aforementioned Interim Order were disposed of vide Final Order  dated  April  05,  2018  also  considering  that  appropriate  action  was initiated against the said 14, 720 entities in a phased manner. During the course of hearing in the case of R. S. Ispat Ltd Vs SEBI, the Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), vide its Order dated October 14, 2019, inter alia observed that “SEBI may consider holding a Lok Adalat or adopting any other alternative dispute resolution process with regard to the Illiquid Stock Options”. Adjudication Order in respect of Jitendra Kumar Somani in the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options at BSEPage 10of 19A   Settlement   Scheme   was   framed   under   the   SEBI   (Settlement Proceedings) Regulations, 2018, which provided one-time opportunity for settlement  of  proceedings  in  the  Illiquid  Stock  Options  matter.  The  said scheme  was  kept  open  from  August  01,  2020  till  December  31,  2020.  Adjudication proceedings were initiated against those entities who had not availed of the opportunity of settlement.Further, another settlement scheme was introduced pursuant to the order of Hon’ble SAT dated May 12, 2022. The details of SEBI settlement scheme is given at paragraph 8 above.19.I further note that there are no timelines prescribed in the SEBI Act, 1992 for the purpose of identifying trades as non-genuine. In this regard, I feel it is pertinent to note that, in the matter of SEBI Vs Bhavesh Pabari(2019) SCC Online SC 294, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India has, inter alia, held that:“There are judgments which hold that when the period of limitation is not prescribed, such power must be exercised within a reasonable time. What would be reasonable time, would depend upon the facts and circumstances of  the  case,  nature  of  the  default/statute,  prejudice  caused,  whether  the third-party rights had been created etc.”20.I shall now proceed to deal with the transactions executed by the Noticee in the alleged non-genuine trades.21.As  can  be  seen from  the  narration  of facts  in  the foregoing  paragraphs, I note that allegation against the Noticee is that, while dealing in the stock option  contracts  at  BSE  during  the  IP,hehad  executed  reversal  trades which were allegedly non-genuine and the same had resulted in generation  Adjudication Order in respect of Jitendra Kumar Somani in the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options at BSEPage 11of 19of  artificial  volume  in  stock  option  contracts  at  BSE.  Reversal  trades  are considered to  bethose  trades  in  which  an  entity  reverseshisbuy  or  sell positions in a contract with subsequent sell or buy positions with the same counterparty during the same day. The said reversal trades are alleged to be  non-genuine  trades  as  they  are  not  executed  in the normal  course  of trading, lack basic trading rationale, lead to false or misleading appearance oftrading  in  terms  of  generation  of  artificial  volumesandhence  are deceptive andmanipulative. 22.Inote from the trade log of the Noticee that hehad traded in 3contractsin the stock  options segment  of  BSE  during  the IP.  It  is  observed  that  the Noticee  had allegedly executed 8non-genuine  trades  in 32contracts.  I further note that the above mentioned trades of the Noticee had resulted inthecreation of  artificial  volume of8,72,000units  in  the said contracts. Summary of non-genuine trades of the Noticee is as follows:S. No.Contract NameAvg. Buy Rate (Rs)Total Buy Volume (No. of units)Avg. Sell Rate (Rs)Total Sell Volume (No. of units)% of Non Genuine trades of Noticee in the contract to Noticee\\'sTotal trades in the Contract% of Non Genuine trades of Noticee in the contract to Total trades in the Contract% of Artificial Volume generated by Noticee in the contract to Noticee\\'s Total Volume in the Contract% of Artificial Volume generated by Noticee in the contract to Total Volume in the Contract1COAL15MAR370.00PE820000032000001005010059.522KOTB15MAR1350.00PE24117500711750010066.6710045.153RLNF15MAR480.00PEW39.751185001.7511850010011.1110042.8623.It  is  noted  that  the  Noticee  had allegedly executed  non-genuine  trades  in said  contracts,  wherein  the  percentage  of alleged non-genuine  trades  of the Noticee in stock options contract to total trades in the contract wasin the range of 11.11% to 66.67%in the aforesaid contracts. Further, alleged  Adjudication Order in respect of Jitendra Kumar Somani in the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options at BSEPage 12of 19artificial volume generated by Noticee in the contract amounted to 100%of total volume generated by himin the contract. It is also noted that alleged artificial  volume  generatedby  the  Noticee  contributed in  the range  of 42.86% to 59.52%of the total volume from the market in the said contract.24.The   details   of   squaring   up   doneby   the   Noticee   in   the   contract ‘RLNF15MAR480.00PEW3’ are as given below :Trade DateClient NameCP Client NameTrade TimeTrade Rate(Rs.)Traded QuantityBuy/Sellby the Noticee03/03/2015EVERGROWING IRON & FINVEST PRIVATE LIMITEDJITENDRA KUMAR SOMANI15:03:501.75118500Sell03/03/2015JITENDRA KUMAR SOMANIEVERGROWING IRON & FINVEST PRIVATE LIMITED15:03:599.75118500Buyi.As can be seen from the table above, the trades executed by the Noticee in thecontractwere squared up within a short span of time, with the same counterparty.  The Noticee  on March03,  2015at 15:03:50hrs  entered into 1 sell trade with counterparty viz. Evergrowing Iron & Finvest Private Limitedfor 1,18,500 units  at  the  average  rate  of ₹1.75per  unit  in  the contract  ‘RLNF15MAR480.00PEW3’. Thereafter,  on  the  same  day, Noticee entered into 1 buy trade at 15:03:59hrs for 1,18,500 unitsat the average rate of ₹9.75per unit.ii.These tradeswere entered into with the same counterpartyin the same contract. It is noted that while dealing in the said contract during the IP, the  Noticee  executed  reversal  trades  with  same  counterpartyviz. Evergrowing  Iron  &  Finvest  Private  Limited,on  the  same day,  with  Adjudication Order in respect of Jitendra Kumar Somani in the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options at BSEPage 13of 19significant price difference.Thus, the Noticee, through itsdealing in the contract  viz. ‘RLNF15MAR480.00PEW3’ during  the  I.P.,  executed  non genuine trades which was11.11% of the total trades from the market in the said contract during the I.P., and thereby, Noticee generated artificial volume of 2,37,000units which was 42.86% of the volume traded in the said contract from the market during the I.P.25.The  non-genuineness  of these  transactions  executed  by  the  Noticee  is evident from the fact that there was no commercial basis as to why, within a   short   span   of   time,   the   Noticeereversed   the   position   withhiscounterparties  with  significant  price  differenceon  the  same  day.  The fact that  the transactions  in  a  particular  contract  were  reversed  with  the  same counterparties indicates a prior meeting of minds with a view to execute the reversal trades at a pre-determined price. Since these trades were done in illiquid option contract, there was negligible trading in the said contract and hence, there was no price discovery in the strictest terms. The wide variation in prices of the said contract, within a short span of time, is a clear indication that there  was  pre-determination  in  the  prices  by  the  counterparties  while executing  the  trades.  Thus,  it  is  observed  that  Noticee  had  indulged  in reversal  trades  with  itscounterpartyin  the  stock  options  segment of  BSE and the same were non-genuine trades.26.I note that it is not mere coincidence that the Noticee could match histrades with  the  same  counterparty  with  whom hehad  undertaken  first  leg  of  the respective trades. The  fact  that  the  transactions  in  a  particular  contract were  reversed with  the  same  counterpartyfor the same quantity of units,indicates    a    prior    meeting    of minds  with  a  view  to  execute  the  reversal trades at a pre-determined price. This is the outcome of meeting of minds elsewhere and it was a deliberate attempt to deal in such a manner. I notein matters dealing with violation of PFUTP Regulations, 2003, the reason as  Adjudication Order in respect of Jitendra Kumar Somani in the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options at BSEPage 14of 19regardsexecution   of   non-genuine   trades   might   notbe   immediately forthcoming.However, thecorrecttest instead, is one of preponderance of probabilities. Here I would like to rely on the judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court  in SEBI  v  Kishore  R  Ajmera(AIR2016SC1079)  decidedonFebruary23,2016,whereinitwas held that-“...According to us, knowledge of who the 2ndparty / client or the broker is, is notrelevant at all. While thescreen based trading system keeps the identity of the parties anonymous it will  be  too  naïve  to  rest  the  final  conclusions  on  the  said  basis  which overlooksameetingofmindselsewhere.Directproofofsuch  meetingofminds elsewhere wouldrarelybeforthcoming...in the absence of direct proof of meeting of minds elsewhere in synchronizedtransactions,thetestshouldbeoneofpreponderanceof probabilities as far as adjudication of civil liability arising  out  of  the  violation  of  the  Act  orprovisionoftheRegulationsisconcerned.Theconclusionhastobe gatheredfromvariouscircumstanceslikethatvolumeofthetradeeffected;the periodofpersistencein tradingin theparticular scrip;theparticularsof thebuy and sell orders, namely, the volume thereof;  the  proximity  of  time  between  the  two  and  such  other relevant factors. The illustrations are not exhaustive...”27.The Hon’ble Supreme Court further held in the same matter that–“It is a fundamental principle of law that proof of an allegation levelled against a person  may  be  in  the form  of  direct  substantive  evidence  or,  as  in  many cases, such proof may have to be inferred by a logical process of reasoning from the totality of the attending facts and circumstances surrounding the allegations/charges  made  and  levelled.  While  direct  evidence  is  a  more certain  basis  to  come  to  a  conclusion,  yet,  in  the  absence  thereof,the Courts  cannot  be  helpless.  It  is  the  judicial  duty  to  take  note  of  the immediate and proximate facts and circumstances surrounding the events on  which  the  charges/allegations  are  founded  and  to  reach  what  would appear  to  the  Court  to  be  a  reasonable  conclusion  therefrom.  The  test  Adjudication Order in respect of Jitendra Kumar Somani in the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options at BSEPage 15of 19would  always  be  that  what  inferential  process  that  a  reasonable/prudent man would adopt to arrive at a conclusion.” The observations made in the aforesaid judgments of Hon’ble Supreme Court  apply  with  full  force  to  the  factsand  circumstances  of  the  present case. Therefore, applying the ratio of the above judgments, I am convinced that the execution of trades by the Noticee in the illiquid options segment with such precision in terms of order placement, time, price, quantity etc. and  also  the  fact  that  the  transactions  were  reversed  with  the  same counterparty  clearly  indicates  a  prior  meeting  of  minds  with  a  view  to execute the reversal trades at a pre-determined price. The only reason for the wide variation in prices of the same contract, within short span of timewas  a  clear  indication  that  there  was  pre-determination  in  the prices  by  both  the counterparty  when  executing  the  trades.  Thus, the  nature  of trading,  as  brought out  above,  clearly  indicates  an  element  of  prior  meeting    of  minds  and  therefore,  a  collusion  of  the  Noticee  with hiscounterparty to carry out the trades at pre-determined prices28.I note the following fromthe judgement of the Hon’ble SAT in the matter of Ketan Parekh vs SEBI(supra):In other words, if the factum of manipulation is established it will necessarily follow that the investors in the market had been induced to buy or sell and that  no  further  proof  in  this  regard  is  required.  The  market,  as  already observed,  is  so wide  spread  that  it  may  not  be  humanly  possible  for  the Board  to  track  the  persons  who  were  actually  induced  to  buy  or  sell securities  as  a  result  of  manipulation  and  law  can  never  impose  on  the Board  a  burden  which  is  impossible  to  be  discharged.  This,  inour  view, clearly flows from the plain language of Regulation 4 (a) of the Regulations. Adjudication Order in respect of Jitendra Kumar Somani in the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options at BSEPage 16of 1929.I also place my reliance on the judgment of Hon’ble SupremeCourt in the matter of SEBI v Rakhi Trading Private Limited(Civil Appeal Nos. 1969, 3174-3177 and 3180 of 2011 decided on February 8, 2018), in which the Hon’ble SC held that -“Considering  the  reversal  transactions,  quantity, price and time and sale, parties being persistent in number of such trade transactions with huge price variations, it will be too naive to hold that the transactions  are  through  screen-based  trading  and  hence  anonymous. Such conclusion would be over-looking the prior meeting of minds involving synchronization of buy and sell order and not negotiated deals as per the board\\'s  circular.  The  impugned  transactions  are  manipulative/deceptive device to create a desired loss and/or profit. Such synchronized trading is violative of transparent norms of trading in securities.....”30.Further, the Hon’ble SAT in its judgement dated September 14, 2020 in the matter of Global Earth Properties and Developers Pvt.Ltd.relied upon the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  judgement  in  the matter of SEBI  v  Rakhi Trading Private Limited(Civil Appeal Nos. 1969, 3174-3177 and 3180 of 2011  decided  on  February  8,  2018),  and  held  that, “It  is  not  a  mere coincidence  that  the  Appellants  could  match  the  trades  with  the  counter party with whom he had undertaken the first leg of respective trade. In our opinion,  the  trades  were  non-genuine  trades  and  even  though  direct evidence  is  not available  in  the  instant  case  but  in  the  peculiar  facts  and circumstances of the present case there is an irresistible inference that can be drawn that there was meeting of minds between the Appellants and the counter parties, and collusion with a view to trade at a predetermined price.”31.Therefore,  the  trading  behaviour  of  the  Noticee  confirms  that  such trades were  not  normal indicatingthat  the  trades  executed  by  the  Noticee  were not  genuine  trades  and  being  non-genuine,  created  an  appearance  of artificial trading volumes in respective contracts. In view of the above, I find  Adjudication Order in respect of Jitendra Kumar Somani in the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options at BSEPage 17of 19that  the  allegation  of  violation  of  regulations  3(a),  (b),  (c),  (d),  4(1)  and 4(2)(a) of PFUTP Regulations, 2003by the Noticee stands established. Issue  No  2:  Does  the  violation,  if  any,  attract monetary  penalty  under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act, 1992 ?33.Considering the findings that the Noticee as mentioned above has executed non-genuine  trades  resulting  in  the  creation  of  artificial  volume,  thereby violating the provisions of Regulation 3(a), (b), (c) & (d) & Regulation 4(1) and 4(2)(a) of the PFUTP Regulations, 2003 and in terms of the judgmentof Hon’ble Supreme Court of  India in the matter of SEBI  Vs.  Shri  RAM Mutual Fund[2006] 68 SCL 216(sc) decided on May 23, 2006 held that “In our considered opinion, penalty is attracted as soon as the contravention of the statutory obligation as contemplated by the Act and the Regulations is established and hence the intention of the parties committing such violation becomes wholly irrelevant...”I am convinced that it is a fit case for imposition of  monetary  penalty  under  the  provisions  of  Section  15  HA  of  SEBI  Act which reads as under:Penalty for fraudulent and unfair trade practices.15HA.If  any  person  indulges  in  fraudulent  and  unfair  trade  practices relating to securities, he shall be liable to a penalty which shall not be less than five lakh rupees but which may extend totwenty -fivecrorerupeesorthreetimestheamountofprofitsmadeoutofsuchpractices, whichever is higher.Issue 3:If so, what would be the quantum of monetary penalty that can be imposed  on  the  Noticee  after  taking  into  consideration  the  factors mentioned in Section 15J of the SEBI Act, 1992? Adjudication Order in respect of Jitendra Kumar Somani in the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options at BSEPage 18of 1934.While determining the quantum of penalty under Section 15HA of SEBI Act, it is important to consider the factors as stipulated in Section 15J of the SEBI Act which reads as under: 15J.While adjudging quantum of penalty under[15-I or section 11 or section 11B, the Board or the adjudicating officer] shall have due regard to the following factors, namely:—(a)  the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default; (b)  the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; (c)  the repetitive nature of the default. [Explanation.—For the removal of doubts, it is clarified that the power to adjudge the quantum of penalty under sections 15A to 15E, clauses (b) and (c) of section 15F, 15G, 15H and 15HA shall be and shall always be deemed to have been exercised under the provisions of this section.]I  observe,  that  the  material  available  on  record  does  not  quantify  any disproportionate gains or unfair advantage, if any, made by the Noticee and the losses, if any, suffered by the investors due to such violations on part of the said Noticee. However, the Noticee has entered into 6non-genuine trades which demonstrates the violation of PFUTP Regulations, 2003.ORDER35.Having considered all the facts and circumstances of the case, the material available on record, the factors mentioned in Section 15J of the SEBI Act, 1992 and in exercise of power conferred upon me under Section 15-I of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Rule 5 of the Adjudication Rules, 1995, I hereby impose following penalty under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act, 1992 on the Noticee: Adjudication Order in respect of Jitendra Kumar Somani in the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options at BSEPage 19of 19Name of the NoticeeViolation provisionsPenaltyJitendra Kumar SomaniPAN:ATCPS5039ARegulations   3(a),   (b),   (c), (d),   4(1)   and   4(2)(a)   of PFUTP Regulations, 2003₹ 5,00,000/-(Rupees    Five    Lakhs only)I   am  of   the   view   that   the   said  penalty   is   commensurate   with   the lapse/omission on the part of the Noticee.36.The Noticee shall remit / pay the said amount of penalty within 45 days of receipt of this order either through online payment facility available on the website of SEBI, i.e. www.sebi.gov.inon the following path, by clicking on the payment link:ENFORCEMENT \\uf0e0Orders \\uf0e0Orders of AO \\uf0e0PAY NOW37.In the event of failure to pay the said amount of penalty within 45 days of the receipt of this Order, SEBI may initiate consequential actions including but not limited to recovery proceedings under Section 28A of the SEBI Act, 1992  for  realization  of  the said  amount  of  penalty  along  with  interest thereon, inter  alia,  by  attachment  and  sale  of  movable  and  immovable properties.38.In terms of the provisions of Rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules, a copy of this order is being sent to the Noticee and also tothe Securities and Exchange Board of India.Date: September 13, 2023G.

BACKGROUND  1.  Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as “SEBI”) observed large scale reversal of trades in the Stock Options segment of the Bombay  Stock  Exchange  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  “BSE”)  leading  to  the alleged creation of artificial volume in the stock options segment. In this regard, SEBI conducted an investigation into the trading activity in the illiquid Stock Options segment at the BSE for the period April 01, 2014 to September 30, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as “Investigation Period”).  2.  It was observed during the course of investigation that a total of 2,91,643 trades comprising 81.38% of all the trades executed in the Stock Options Segment at the BSE during the investigation period were trades which involved reversal of buy and sell positions by the clients and counterparties in a contract on the same day. It was observed that Ms. Sakuntala Agarwal (PAN: AAYPA3630J) (hereinafter  referred  to  as  “Noticee”)  was  one  of  the  various  entities  who indulged in execution of reversal trades in stock options segment of BSE during the investigation period. Such trades were alleged to be non-genuine in nature and created false or misleading appearance of trading in the illiquid stock options. In view of the same, SEBI initiated adjudication proceedings against the Noticee for alleged violation of the provisions of Regulations 3(a), (b), (c), (d),  4(1)  and  4(2)(a)  of  SEBI  (Prohibition  of  Fraudulent  and  Unfair  Trade  Adjudication Order in respect of Late Ms. Sakuntala Agarwal in the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options at BSE Page 2 of 3Practices) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as “PFUTP Regulations, 2003”). APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATING OFFICER  3.  SEBI  initiated  adjudication  proceedings  and  appointed  the  undersigned  as Adjudicating Officer under section 15-I of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as “SEBI Act”) read with rule 3 of the SEBI  (Procedure  for  Holding  Inquiry  and  Imposing  Penalties)  Rules,  1995 (hereinafter referred to as “Adjudication Rules”) vide order dated July 02, 2021 to inquire into and adjudge under section 15HA of the SEBI Act against the Noticee  for  the  alleged  violation  of  the  aforesaid  provisions  of  PFUTP Regulations, 2003.  SHOW CAUSE NOTICE, REPLY AND HEARING 4.  A    Show    Cause    Notice    bearing    reference    no. SEBI/HO/ISD1/DIV6/2021/OW/P/22735/1/EN-1838 dated September 06, 2021 (hereinafter referred to as “SCN”) was issued to the Noticee under Rule 4(1) of the Adjudication Rules to show cause as to why an inquiry should not be initiated against the Noticee and why penalty should not be imposed upon the Noticee under Section 15HA of the SEBI Act for the violations alleged to have been committed by the Noticee.  5.  The undersigned was informed vide letter dated January 07, 2022 that the Noticee had passed away on October 20, 2015. A copy of the Death Certificate dated November 02, 2015 issued by Department of Planning and Development, Directorate of Statistics and Evaluation, Jharkhand in case of this entity was attached along with the said letter.  6.  Thus, the proceedings are against the acts of omission and commission of person who is no more to face the charges. In this regard, it is relevant to note that the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Girija Nandini vs. Bijendra Narain (AIR 1967 SC 1124), inter‐alia, observed that in case of personal action, i.e. the actions where the relief sought is personal to the deceased, the right to sue will  Adjudication Order in respect of Late Ms. Sakuntala Agarwal in the matter of trading in Illiquid Stock Options at BSE Page 3 of 3not survive to or against the representatives, and in such cases, the maxim “actio personalis moritur cum persona” (personal action dies with the death of the person) would apply. It is also relevant to refer to the decision of Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in Chandravadan J. Dalal vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 35/2004 decided on June 15, 2005) wherein it was held that: “The  appeal  abates  since  the  appellant  during  the  pendency  of  the  appeal  died  on  29th  November 2004. The appeal accordingly abates. The penalty imposed on the original appellant being personal in nature also abates.”7.  In the matter under consideration, the Noticee expired before the issuance of SCN. Therefore, I am of the view that the adjudication proceedings initiated against the Noticee do not survive and are liable to be abated without going into the merits of the case. Consequently, no penalty is imposed on the Noticee who is  deceased  and  the  Adjudication  Proceedings  against  the  Noticee  stand abated.  ORDER  8.  After taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case, the Adjudication Proceedings initiated against the Noticee, viz. Late Ms. Sakuntala Agarwal  (PAN  AAYPA3630J),  vide  SCN  bearing  reference  no. SEBI/HO/ISD1/DIV6/2021/OW/P/22735/1/EN-1838 dated September 06, 2021 are disposed of accordingly.  9.  In terms of Rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules, a copy of this order is sent to the Noticee’s last known address and also to SEBI.

Adjudication order in the matter of inspection of Catalyst  Trusteeship Limited Page  4 of  15 d) It also placed reliance on para 5, 6  and 7 of Section B of SEBI Circular dated  November 3, 2020 wherein para 6 allows DT to carryout due diligence through  the experts in the relevant fields, engaged by DT and that it had engaged the  services of M/s Tolwani & Associates after carrying out due  process. e) With  respect  to  t he  security  cover  in  September 2021 and  December  2021  quarters no specific action was taken since the value of the security as certified  by the CA was more than the required percentage and that it was only in the  March 2022 sharp decline in the asset cover percentage was noticed which  was  however  more than the required percentage of asset cover. f) With  regard  to  the  above,  Noticee had  sought  clarification  from  Tolwani  wherein it was informed to i t that in earlier two quarters, all the assets of the  company  were  considered  for  the  purpose  of  asset  cover  of  debentures  instead of specified security and that this mistake was rectified in March 2022 . g) Noticee  also  submitted  that  t he  requirement  of  empa nelment  of  various  agencies, including CAs started from April, 2021 and that the mistake was on  the  part  of  CA  which  was  not  affecting  the  interest  of  debenture  holders  adversely . h) The Asset Cover Certificate (ACC) as on  M arch 31, 2022 was submitted by  Tolwani on June 24, 2022 while the Statutory Auditors certificate is dated July  28,  2022.  Since  the  dates  of  valuation  by  both  the  Tolwani  and  Statutory  Auditor are different as also the dates of certificates issued by them and that  the  Noticee  did  not  hav e  the  certificates  available  for  comparison  for  taking  further action . i) At last Noticee submitted that u pon getting the information about inadequacy  of  security  cover  from  company  as  well  as  Statutory  Auditor  on  August  03,  2022  all  necessary  steps  were  tak en,  including  informing  the  debenture  holders and the asset cover certificate was also obtained from another CA firm  namely Omprakash Kedia &  C o (OKC) confirming adequacy of security cover . Adjudication order in the matter of inspection of Catalyst  Trusteeship Limited Page  5 of  15 8. Taking into account the aforesaid facts, I am of the view that principles of natural  justice  have  been  duly  followed  in  the  matter  by  granting  the  Noticee,  an  opportunity  for  replying  to  the  SCN  and  of  being  heard.  Therefore,  I  deem  it  appropriate  to  decid e  the  matter  on  the  basis  of  the  facts/material  available  on  record and replies submitted by the Noticee .  CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES AND FINDINGS: - 9. I  have  carefully  perused  the  charges  levelled  against  the  Noticee  and  the  documents / material available  on record.

Issue No. III: If so, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed  upon the Noticee taking into consideration the factors stipulated in Sec tion  15J of the SEBI Act? 10. Before proceeding further, I would like to refer to the relevant provisions of law as  under : Adjudication order in the matter of inspection of Catalyst  Trusteeship Limited Page  6 of  15 Relevant provisions of  SEBI (Debenture Trustee) Regulations, 1993 Duties of the Debenture Trustees Regulation 15 [(1)] It shall be the duty of every debenture trustee to - (s) exercise due diligence to ensure compliance by the body corporate, with the  provisions of the Companies Act, Securities and Exchange Board of Ind ia (Listing Obligations and  Disclosure Requirement), Regulations, 2015, the listing agreement of the stock exchange or the  trust deed or any other regulations issued by the Board pertaining to debt issue; (t) In case where listed debt secur ities are secured, it shall,  - (i) on a Quarterly basis - (a) carry out the necessary due diligence and monitor the security cover in the  manner as may be specified by the Board from time to time.

Adjudication order in the matter of inspection of Catalyst  Trusteeship Limited Page  8 of  15 Alleged  violation  1:  Conflict  of  interest  in  carrying  out  independent  due  diligence of the issuer 11. With   respect   to   the   captioned   allegation,  I   note  from   the   IR   that   email  communications took place between the Noticee and Varroc Engineering Limited  (VEL) ( which was one of the companies selected by the inspecting t eam out of the  sample  of  46  issues  of  listed  Non - Convertible  Debentures  of  40  companies  handled by the Noticee during the  inspection period )  vide email dated August 27,  2021, August 28, 2021 and August 30, 2021 . 12. The   aforementioned   email   communications   were  in   addition   to   an   email  communication  between  the  Noticee  and  a  Chartered  Accountancy  (CA)  firm  namely  Unicus  Risk  Advisors  LLP  vide  email  dated  August  30,  2021  which  are  mentioned as below: Email dated August 27, 2021 from VEL to the Noticee read as mentioned below : “... .. Also  we  have  the  Chartered  Accountant  in  Aurangabad/Pune  who  can  provide  requisite support for the proposed NCD transaction. Please check and let us know ..”. 13. I  further  note from  IR  that  th e  email  dated  August,  28,  2021,  from  VEL  to  the  Noticee had an enclosure containing the CA firm profile namely which had profiles  of the following partners of the said CA firm: CA Aaditya Dastane CA Tejas Dharwadkar CA Anushkumar Shivaraman CA Shashank To lwani CA Rajesh Phadke CA Berinder Sahni Adjudication order in the matter of inspection of Catalyst  Trusteeship Limited Page  9 of  15 14. Further, I note from IR that an email dated August 30, 2021 from the Noticee to  VEL inter alia stated the following: “ We  have  shared  the  mail  to  the  CA  provided  at  your  end  for  Due  Diligence  process”. 15. Again  an  email  dated  August  30,  2021  from  the  Noticee  to  CA  firm  read  as  mentioned below: “Dear Sir, Please refer our discussion. Please let us know if M/s Varroc Engineering Limited is in prior interest to your firm  in order to avoid any discrepancy/conflict of i nterest. Post  your  confirmation,  we  shall  share  the  signed  NDA  cum  Engagement  Letter  with you. Further, attached is the SEBI circular dated November 03, 2020 and November 12,  2020 for your easy reference. In case of any clarification, please feel free to r evert.”  16. In  this  regard,  I  note  from  IR  that  a  Non - Disclosure  Agreement  (NDA)  cum  Engagement letter dated August 31, 2021 was executed between the Noticee and  M/s  Tolwani & Associates (Tolwani) for the purpose of preparing the asset cover  certificate (ACC) as  part  of  Initial  Due  Diligence  for  VEL.  The  signatory  to  this  agreement  was  Mr.  Shashank  Tolwani,  who  was  a  common  partner  between  Tolwani & Associates and aforesaid CA firm.  17. With  regard  to  above,  I  also  note  from IR  that  the  NDA  cum  Engagement  letter  executed between the Noticee and  Tolwani was executed on August 31, 2021 i.e  3 days after VEL recommending CA firm and 2 days after the Noticee informing  VEL about sharing of email to the CA firm for the purpose of du e diligence, as is  also evident from the email communications mentioned hereinabove and that the  ACC of VEL was provided by Tolwani to the Noticee. 18. With  regard  to  the  aforesaid ,  the  Noticee  made  a  submission  that  it  had  a  very  limited client - base in and around Aurangabad, unlike in metros and  that there was  Adjudication order in the matter of inspection of Catalyst  Trusteeship Limited Page  10 of  15 no conflict of interest between the issuer company i.e. VEL and the said CA firm  since  it  did  not  engage  the  said  CA  firm  suggested  by  VEL rather  Tolwani was  en gaged for after following due process for the issuance of  ACC . 19. Noticee further added that VEL had not suggested or recommended the name of  Tolwani except  the  fact  that  Mr  Shashank  Tolwani  was  one  of  the  6 common  partners of the said CA firm and  Tolwani . Accordingly, it’ s totally incorrect to draw  a conclusion that mere suggesting name by issuer company, am ounts to conflict  of interest and/ or only because one of the 6 partners in a firm suggested and firm  finally en g aged is common. 20. It  also  place d reliance  on  para  5,  6  and  7  of  Section  B  of  SEBI  Circular  dated  November 3, 2020 wherein para 6 allows DT to carryout due diligence through the  experts in the relevant fields, engaged by DT and that it had engaged the services  of  Tolwani after carrying ou t due process .  21. With regard to the Noticee’s  aforesaid  sub mission, I note that  merely suggesting  name of a CA firm which was not even engaged by the Noticee does not amount  to conflict of interest as alleged in the SCN. Further , existence of the common CA between the said firms  cannot be construed as  a conflict of interest wherein the  Noticee  had duly obtained  confirmation from Tolwani w.r.t conflict of interest with  VEL vide its email dated August 30, 2021 wherein Tol w ani had confirmed of not  having any c onflict of interest.  22. I further note from the reply of the Noticee submitted to the inspecting team that  while  examining the profile of the  said CA firm , it had observed that the said CA  fi r m  was  a  consulting  firm  and  not  ICAI  registered  and  subsequently ,  Tolwani ,  which  was  ICAI  registered,  was  appointed  for  the  preparation  of  ACC .  The  aforesaid  shows  that  the  Noticee  had  exercised  due  diligence  which  can  be  expected from a prudent DT. 23. Accordingly, I find  that  the material available on record is not suff icient to establish  violation r egarding its failure to exercise independence in carrying out due diligence  Adjudication order in the matter of inspection of Catalyst  Trusteeship Limited Page  11 of  15 in the case of VEL by appointing  Tolwani for the preparation of  ACC and therefore  Noticeee is not in  violation of the provisions of  Regulation 15(6)  of DT Regulations  and SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MIRSD/CRADT/CIR/P/2020/218 dated November 03,  2020 . Alleged violation 2:  Non - maintenance of Asset cover/Security Cover and failure  to exercise Independence in carrying out due diligence 24. I further note from  IR that during the course of inspection in the case of VEL, the  minimum security cover to be maintained on continuous basis as per Debenture  Trust Deed (DTD) and placement memorandum was 110%. However, as per the  ACC provided  to  the  Noticee  by  its  empanele d  firm Tolwani,  following  was  the  asset covers maintained by VEL, which is as shown in table 1 below: Table 1: Quarter ended Asset cover (times) September 2021 6.22 December 2021 6.56 March 2022 1.93 25. Further, I note from IR that the same certificates were relied upon by the Noticee  for preparation of  ACC for submitting to Stock Exchange which mentioned that the  asset  cover  is  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  issue/  DTD  for  Quarters  ending  September 2021, December 2021 and  March 2022.  26. I  also  note  from  IR  that  the  Statutory  Auditor  Report  of  VEL  for  the  year  ended  on  March 2022 stated that the requisite Security cover of 110% is not maintained as per  terms of Placement Memorandum and Trust Deed for the year ended March 2022 .  27. With regard to the aforesaid, Noticee submitted that  w.r.t to the security cover in  Sept ember 2021  and Dec ember 2021 quarters , no specific action was taken since  the  value  of  the  security  as  certified  by  the  CA  was  more  than  the  required  Adjudication order in the matter of inspection of Catalyst  Trusteeship Limited Page  12 of  15 percentage and that it was only in the March 2022 sharp decline in the asset cover  percentage was noticed which was  however  more than the required percentage of  asset cover. 28. Noticee  further  submitted  that  with  regard  to  the  aforesaid,  it had sought  clarification fr om  Tolwani wherein it was informed to  it that in earlier two quarters ,  all the assets of the company were considered for the purpose of asset cover of  debentures  instead  of  specified  security  and  that  this  mistake  was rectified  in  March 2022 . It further  submitted that the mistake was on the part of CA which was  not affecting the interest of debenture holders adversely . 29. Noticee  additionally  also  submitted  that  the  ACC as  on  M arch  31,  202 2  was  submitted by  Tolwani on  June 24,  2022 while the Statutory Auditors  certificate  is  dated  July 28,  2022. Since the dates of valuation by both the Tolwani and Statutory  Auditor  were different and that the Noticee did not have the certificates available  for  comparison  for  taking  further  action. It  further  a dded  that  u pon  getting  the  information about inadequacy of security cover from company as well as Statutory  Auditor on August 03, 2022 all n ecessary steps were taken, including i nforming the  debenture  holders and  obtaining  ACC from  another  CA firm namely  O mprakash  Kedia & C o (OKC) which had  confirm ed the  adequacy of security cover . 30. From the above submission of the Noticee, I note that  the Noticee  re l i ed upon the  reports submitted by CAs and that it would be grossly wrong to assume that the  certificate issued by Tolwani was wrong and Statutory Auditor’s was correct since  both are practicing CAs and that Noticee had taken sufficient steps to protect the  interest of Debenture holders which is evident f rom the course of action including  getting  report  from  another  CA  firm  i.e.  OKC which  confirmed  the  adequacy  of  security coverage. The relevant extract from the OKC report reads as mentioned  below: “The company had issued the NCD. The security cover as pe r the valuation report  shared is enough and the sufficient cover as required is maintained. The same is  Adjudication order in the matter of inspection of Catalyst  Trusteeship Limited Page  13 of  15 as per the borrowing data’s and that Valuation report shared with us. We assume  that this Assets for which Valuation report is shared belongs to company .” 31. In  this  regard,  I  note  that  the  aforesaid  certificate  was  issued  on  the  basis  of  information / documents / financial results / asset cover certificate as provided by  the issuer company i.e. VEL which shows that there was adequate security cover. 32. With  regard to the aforesaid, it is further pertinent to mention  C lause 6 and 7 of the  SEBI circular dated November 3, 2020 which prescribes the procedure for carrying  out due diligence which is extracted as under: “6 . Debenture trustee(s) by itself or through its advisers or experts shall  independently carry out due diligence. The terms and conditions with respect  to exercising due diligence shall also be included in the debenture trustee  agreement. The due diligence to be exercised by debenture trustee(s) wit h  respect to creation of security shall inter - alia include the following: 6.1 Debenture trustee shall verify that the assets provided by issuer  for creation of security are free from any encumbrances or necessary  permissions  or  consents  has  been  obtained from  existing  charge  holders by carrying out the following checks:  (a) Verify from Registrar of Companies, Sub - registrar, CERSAI,  IU or other sources where charge is registered / disclosed as per  terms.  (b)  In  case  of  conditional  consent/  permission  re ceived  as  per  para 4.3(b) above:  I. Verify whether such conditional consent / permission  given to issuer by existing charge holders is valid as  per terms of transaction documents;  II. Intimate to existing charge holders via e - mail about  the proposal to create further charge on assets by  issuer seeking their comments / objections, if any, to  be communicated to debenture trustees within next 5  working days.  6.2 In case of personal guarantee, corporate guarantee and any  other guarantees / form of security, the debenture trustee shall  verify the relevant filings made on websites of Ministry of Corporate  Adjudication order in the matter of inspection of Catalyst  Trusteeship Limited Page  14 of  15 Affairs, Stock Exchange(s), CIBIL, IU etc. and obtain apprais al  report, necessary financial certificates viz. from statutory auditor in  case of corporate guarantee, certificate from Chartered Accountant  in case of personal guarantee, as applicable, of the guarantor /  issuer. 7. Debenture trustee, by itself or throu gh its appointed agencies viz. chartered  accountant firm, registered valuer, legal counsel etc., shall prepare one or  more reports viz. valuation report, ROC search report, title search  report/appraisal report, asset cover certificate, any other report/cer tificate as  applicable etc. and shall independently assess that the assets for creation of  security are adequate for the proposal issue of debt securities.” 33. I note from the aforesaid Clause s 6 and 7  of the circular dated November 3, 2020  that the debenture trustees  by  itself or through its adviser s or  expert s shall carry  out due diligence and C lause 7 of the circular further clarifies that the debenture  trustees  may  by  itself  or  through  a  chartered  ac countant  firm  prepare  an  asset  cover certificate. Thus, a debenture trustee can carry out due diligence and submit  reports through a Chartered Accountant . Accordingly, in view of  the above, in the  instant  case,  the  Noticee  followed  the  same  and  accordingly ,  I  am  inclined  to  accept the submission advanced by the Noticee. 34. I also  note the  the  Hon’ble SAT  in the matter  IDBI Trusteeship Services Limited  Vs SEBI (Appeal No. 186 of 2023)  held that “ We may also point out that every  irregularity or deficiency  noticed during the course of inspection does not call for  initiation of penalty proceedings .The purpose of inspection is to advise the entity  to  cure  the  lapse  that have been  found. If  any  serious  lapse  is  discovered,  then  penalty action can be taken” . 35. I n view of the above and in line with the aforesaid order of Hon’ble SAT ,  I find that  the Noticee had  exercise d proper due diligence in monitoring of security cover by  the  issuer  in  the  matter  of  VEL  with  respect  to  the  appointment  of  Tolwani  for  carrying  out due diligence at the tim e of security creation which was not  a conflict  of interest . Accordingly,  I find that the Noticee is not in violation  of the  provisions of  Adjudication order in the matter of inspection of Catalyst  Trusteeship Limited Page  15 of  15 Regulation  15(1)(s),  Regulation  15(1)(t)  and  Regulation  16  and  C lause  4  of  Schedule  III o f SEBI (DT) Regulations. 36. Since,  violatio ns  are  not  established,  ISSUE - II and  III do  not  require  any  consideration. ORDER 37. Accordingly,  the  Adjudication  proceeding s  initiated  against  the  Noticee vide  the  SCN dated  July 25 , 20 23 stand disposed of without  any penalty . 38. In terms of the provisions of rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules, a copy of this order  is being sent to the Noticee and also to the Securities and Exchange Board of India.
